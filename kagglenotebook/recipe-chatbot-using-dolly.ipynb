    "<h1>Recipe Helper Chatbot using Langchain Dolly-v2-3b Model</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Kaggle notebook, we will explore how to build a recipe helper chatbot using the powerful Langchain Dolly-v2-3b language model. The chatbot will assist users in finding recipes, providing cooking instructions, and offering personalized recommendations. We will leverage the rich RecipeNLG dataset available on Kaggle to train and fine-tune the Dolly-v2-3b model, enabling it to generate contextually relevant and informative recipe answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Understanding Dolly-v2-3b:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dolly-v2-3b is a state-of-the-art conversational AI language model specifically designed for interactive applications. It possesses advanced language understanding capabilities and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. We will explore the key features and architecture of the Dolly-v2-3b model, highlighting its suitability for building our recipe helper chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preparing the Recipe Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will acquire the RecipeNLG dataset from Kaggle, which contains a vast collection of cooking recipes. We will perform data preprocessing, including cleaning, formatting, and organizing the dataset to ensure compatibility with the Dolly-v2-3b model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrating Langchain:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the large-scale nature of the recipe dataset, we will leverage Langchain, a powerful tool for managing and loading language data efficiently. We will explore the process of creating and optimizing the Langchain, enabling seamless access and retrieval of recipe information during chatbot interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training and Fine-tuning Dolly-v2-3b:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Langchain and the RecipeNLG dataset, we will train and fine-tune the Dolly-v2-3b model specifically for recipe-related tasks. We will delve into the training process, including data preparation, model configuration, and optimization techniques, ensuring that the model becomes proficient in generating accurate and informative recipe answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrating the Chatbot Functionality: **\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop the recipe helper chatbot by incorporating the trained Dolly-v2-3b model into our application. We will build an intuitive user interface, allowing users to enter recipe queries and receive generated recipe answers based on the chatbot's understanding of natural language inputs"
